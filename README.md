## Where have the Settings gone?
If you have visited the website before the big rewrite, then you might know there was a settings page, where you could customize the whole website according to your needs and how you like colors on a website. Well, it is now removed because even though it works fine on many devices, it is very bugged/glitchy in some devices, and changing the settings on those devices would result in the whole website not working. The previous version of the website loaded many unused resources and it put a huge load on a user's device, often times making the whole device work slow.<br>
Hence, the new update fixes it all and the settings removed because of the aforementioned reasons.

## Bugs / Suggestions
You can post bugs or suggestions in the <a href="https://github.com/chill31/chill31.github.io/issues">Issues</a> page. The suggestion will be reviewed, and if accepted, it will be added to the website after some time.
Bugs will be taken into action immediately and fixed on the website in the next update.
