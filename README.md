:: owners words:
I like to `code` a lot, especially making websites, in the process of learning `python`, and started learning `java` 2 weeks ago.

I like/dislike github for a few reasons:

| Pros | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Free hosting | Long and annoying process of commiting and pushing code. |
| saving process of code so if you make unwanted changes, you can delete them | Hosting does not work unless a repository is public | 

> github is good, do not get me wrong here.
