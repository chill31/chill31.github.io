<span>The Perfect Utility Website</span>

Originally the portfolio for ( you guessed it, or not, I don't know ) [Chill31](https://discord.gg/xSvc2kQezt), it is still a portfolio, but mainly a Utility website. <br>
This website contains projects ( for you guys ) inspired from youtube channels ( small and big ) for things you will search hard for. From random number generators to language translators and weather reporters, this contains everything you ever needed for your daily life.

<br>

By the way, this website provides **total** customization over most things, from fonts to custom colors, anything you don't like, you change it. <br>
There are 5 preset themes and infinite amounts of custom colors you can make. Fonts are of two types, Normal and Code. Normal is pretty much present everywhere on the website, while Code Font is present on textboxes, sometimes buttons, and some more things.

<br>

There are particle and shortcut settings, which you can disable or enable, whichever you like.
<br>
*New Features coming soon!*

## Suggestions
You can always leave suggestions on our discord, just click on the link above and write out your suggestions. <br>
If you know how to code and can write out that program for us, it would be better, so I can analyze and merge it if it's good.
Check [Forking and Pull Requests](#forks-and-prs).

<br>

## Bugs / Glitches
Github has a page for bugs and glitches where you can report anything you find which is a (probable) bug. This helps me a lot because then I won't have to debug and search the whole website for some glitches.

<br>

## Forking and PR's
Forking the repository and Pull Requests. A topic for developers. <br>
You can fork the repo by a fork button which github provides on the top right ( more or less ) on the home page of the repository.
You can then create a pull request by going to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/chill31/chill31.github.io/pulls) and providing your repo in there.
I can then see your changes and if I like them, They will be merged, and boom, You're a contributor!
