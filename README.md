<span>The Perfect Utility Website</span>

Originally the portfolio for ( you guessed it, or not, I don't know ) [Chill31](https://discord.gg/xSvc2kQezt), it is still a portfolio, but mainly a Utility website. <br>
This website contains projects ( for you guys ) inspired from youtube channels ( small and big ) for things you will search hard for. From random number generators to language translators and weather reporters, this contains everything you ever needed for your daily life.

<br>

By the way, this website provides **total** customization over most things, from fonts to custom colors, anything you don't like, you change it. <br>
There are 5 preset themes and infinite amounts of custom colors you can make. Fonts are of two types, Normal and Code. Normal is pretty much present everywhere on the website, while Code Font is present on textboxes, sometimes buttons, and some more things.

<br>

There are particle and shortcut settings, which you can disable or enable, whichever you like.
<br>
_New Features coming soon!_

## Using the Site:

### Basic:
To navigate throughout the main pages, use the menu or the shortcut menu with the icons on it, the shortcuts may not be visible on smaller screens, because of their size not fitting in smaller screens.

If you have a small screen and the icons are not visible, then click on the 3 lines and it will open up a menu with all the main navigation pages.

*Ham Menu & Shortcut Menu*

### Home Page:
Basically the portfolio, tells a little about Chill31 ( me ) and then provides links in the end for you to navigate to.

*Home Page [Default]*
<img width="960" alt="home-page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89910163/180845689-aa69ba06-2ce2-4825-9198-49377b5dcf5a.png">


there are about 5 sections, excluding the last links sections, and each of the headings in them is clickable, so if you are to click on them, it will scroll to the section the header was present in.


### Projects Page:
Here you can check out the utilities mentioned above, You can select a display mode of slider or grid, slider shows one project at a time, and grid shows all of them *(scroll)*


*Projects Page [default]*
<img width="960" alt="projects-page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89910163/180844152-47279840-012e-454d-80f0-a196c95be08c.png">

In here, there's a button after the main header, with the table like icon, when you click on it, it toggles between grid mode and slider mode, the grid mode is to explore all the slides at once, and the slider for one at a time with a clean animation.

You can select a default display mode through settings to always have it open to that display mode instead of changing it everytime you enter:

Settings -> Display -> Projects Default Display -> *your display mode*.


### Settings Page:
Customize everything here, you can disable the shortcuts, enable/disable notifications which appear after certain actions, or reset everything back to default. Explore the settings page divided into 3 sections.

*Settings Page [default]*

There are sub pages, like display, appearance, and preferences, which direct you to more options, like if you click on the display option, it shows you fonts, menu placement and more.

## Suggestions

You can always leave suggestions on our discord, just click on the link above and write out your suggestions. <br>
If you know how to code and can write out that program for us, it would be better, so I can analyze and merge it if it's good.
Check [Forking and Pull Requests](#forks-and-prs).

### fonts:
If you want to have a font in the website which you think suits the overall look of the site, the  don't just give a font name and expect it to be there. Explain why it should be there, provide a google fonts or any font provider link to the font you want, and send some screenshots of the font in usage.

### feature requests:
If you want new features or new options in the website, then you can just mail or send me a message at the discord given below, and a good reason why it should be there, this option is also available on github in the issues page, if you want to directly send it here.

## Bugs / Glitches

Github has a page for bugs and glitches where you can report anything you find which is a (probable) bug. This helps me a lot because then I won't have to debug and search the whole website for some glitches.

<br>

## Forking and PR's

Forking the repository and Pull Requests. A topic for developers. <br>
You can fork the repo by a fork button which github provides on the top right ( more or less ) on the home page of the repository.
You can then create a pull request by going to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/chill31/chill31.github.io/pulls) and providing your repo in there.
I can then see your changes and if I like them, They will be merged, and boom, You're a contributor!
