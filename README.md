<span>The Perfect Utility Website</span>

Originally the portfolio for ( you guessed it, or not, I don't know ) [Chill31](https://discord.gg/xSvc2kQezt), it is still a portfolio, but mainly a Utility website. <br>
This website contains projects ( for you guys ) inspired from youtube channels ( small and big ) for things you will search hard for. From random number generators to language translators and weather reporters, this contains everything you ever needed for your daily life.

<br>

By the way, this website provides **total** customization over most things, from fonts to custom colors, anything you don't like, you change it. <br>
There are 5 preset themes and infinite amounts of custom colors you can make. Fonts are of two types, Normal and Code. Normal is pretty much present everywhere on the website, while Code Font is present on textboxes, sometimes buttons, and some more things.

<br>

There are particle and shortcut settings, which you can disable or enable, whichever you like.
<br>
_New Features coming soon!_

## Using the Site:

### Basic:
To navigate throughout the main pages, use the menu or the shortcut menu with the icons on it, the shortcuts may not be visible on smaller screens, because of their size not fitting in smaller screens.

If you have a small screen and the icons are not visible, then click on the 3 lines and it will open up a menu with all the main navigation pages.

## Suggestions

You can always leave suggestions on our discord, just click on the link above and write out your suggestions. <br>
If you know how to code and can write out that program for us, it would be better, so I can analyze and merge it if it's good.
Check [Forking and Pull Requests](#forks-and-prs).

### fonts:
If you want to have a font in the website which you think suits the overall look of the site, the  don't just give a font name and expect it to be there. Explain why it should be there, provide a google fonts or any font provider link to the font you want, and send some screenshots of the font in usage.

### feature requests:
If you want new features or new options in the website, then you can just mail or send me a message at the discord given below, and a good reason why it should be there, this option is also available on github in the issues page, if you want to directly send it here.

<br>

## Bugs / Glitches

Github has a page for bugs and glitches where you can report anything you find which is a (probable) bug. This helps me a lot because then I won't have to debug and search the whole website for some glitches.

<br>

## Forking and PR's

Forking the repository and Pull Requests. A topic for developers. <br>
You can fork the repo by a fork button which github provides on the top right ( more or less ) on the home page of the repository.
You can then create a pull request by going to [Pull Requests](https://github.com/chill31/chill31.github.io/pulls) and providing your repo in there.
I can then see your changes and if I like them, They will be merged, and boom, You're a contributor!
